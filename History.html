      Intelligent robots and artificial beings first appeared in the ancient
      Greek myths of Antiquity. Aristotle's development of the syllogism and
      it's use of deductive reasoning was a key moment in mankind's quest to
      understand its own intelligence. While the roots are long and deep, the
      history of artificial intelligence as we think of it today spans less than
      a century. The following is a quick look at some of the most important
      events in AI.

            Warren McCullough and Walter Pitts publish "A Logical Calculus of
            Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity." The paper proposed the first
            mathematic model for building a neural network.

            In his book The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological
            Theory, Donald Hebb proposes the theory that neural pathways are
            created from experiences and that connections between neurons become
            stronger the more frequently they're used. Hebbian learning
            continues to be an important model in AI.
