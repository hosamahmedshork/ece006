    <h3>Can machines think? â€” Alan Turing, 1950</h3>
    <p>
      Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and
      helping the Allied Forces win World War II, mathematician Alan Turing
      changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can machines
      think?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and it's
      subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and vision of
      artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
      At it's core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer
      Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or
      simulate human intelligence in machines.
    </p>

    <p>
      The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many
      questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the
      field is universally accepted.
    </p>

    <p>
      The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines that are
      intelligent" is that it doesn't actually explain what artificial
      intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent?
    </p>

    <p>
      In their groundbreaking textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
      Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach the question by
      unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in machines.
      With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents that receive percepts from
      the environment and perform actions." (Russel and Norvig viii)

    <h3>
      <p>
        Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different approaches that have
        historically defined the field of AI:
      </p>
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Thinking humanly</li>
      <li>Thinking rationally</li>
      <li>Acting humanly</li>
      <li>Acting rationally</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <p>
      The first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while the
      others deal with behavior. Norvig and Russell focus particularly on
      rational agents that act to achieve the best outcome, noting "all the
      skills needed for the Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally."
      (Russel and Norvig 4).
    </p>

    <p>
      Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and
      computer science at MIT, defines AI as "algorithms enabled by constraints,
      exposed by representations that support models targeted at loops that tie
      thinking, perception and action together."
    </p>

    <p>
      While these definitions may seem abstract to the average person, they help
      focus the field as an area of computer science and provide a blueprint for
      infusing machines and programs with machine learning and other subsets of
      artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
      While addressing a crowd at the Japan AI Experience in 2017, DataRobot CEO
      Jeremy Achin began his speech by offering the following definition of how
      AI is used today:
    </p>

    <p>
      "AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require
      human intelligence... Many of these artificial intelligence systems are
      powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and
      some of them are powered by very boring things like rules."
