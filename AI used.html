    <h4>
      <p>Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories:</p>
    </h4>
    <h2>Narrow AI:</h2>
    <h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence
        operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human
        intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task
        extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are
        operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most
        basic human intelligence.
      </p>
    </h4>
    <h2>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</h2>
    <h4>
      <p>
        AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial
        intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or
        Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general
        intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that
        intelligence to solve any problem.

      <li>Smart assistants (like Siri and Alexa)</li>
      <li>Disease mapping and prediction tools</li>
      <li>Manufacturing and drone robots</li>
      <li>Optimized, personalized healthcare treatment recommendations</li>
      <li>Conversational bots for marketing and customer service</li>
      <li>Robo-advisors for stock trading</li>
      <li>Spam filters on email</li>

    <h2>Narrow Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Narrow AI is all around us and is easily the most successful realization
      of artificial intelligence to date. With its focus on performing specific
      tasks, Narrow AI has experienced numerous breakthroughs in the last decade
      that have had "significant societal benefits and have contributed to the
      economic vitality of the nation," according to "Preparing for the Future
      of Artificial Intelligence," a 2016 report released by the Obama
      Administration.
    </p>
    <h3>A few examples of Narrow AI include:</h3>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>Google search</li>
      <li>Image recognition software</li>
      <li>Siri, Alexa and other personal assistants</li>
      <li>Self-driving cars</li>
      <li>IBM's Watson</li>
